      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1 ",
        "b": "An ammeter is an instrument that is used to measure the current flowing through the circuit. It has low resistance, ideally zero.By connecting the ammeter in series allows all of the circuit current to pass through it, and hence measure it.",

      "question": "3.What is the purpose of determining the electrochemical equivalent of copper ?",
      "answers": {
        "a": " To calculate the atomic mass of copper",
        "b": "To determine the amount of copper deposited during electrolysis",
        "c": "To measure the conductivity of copper",
        "d": " To determine the oxidation state of copper",
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1 ",
        "b": "The electrochemical equivalent of copper is the amount of copper deposited during electrolysis per unit charge passed through the electrolyte. This helps in understanding the relationship between electric current and the amount of substance deposited.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "Inversely proportional",
        "b": "Directly proportional",
        "c": "No relationship",
        "d": " Exponential relationship",
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 2 ",
        "b": "According to Faraday's laws of electrolysis, the amount of substance deposited during electrolysis is directly proportional to the electric charge passed through the electrolyte. Therefore, the electrochemical equivalent of copper is directly proportional to the electric charge passed.",
        "c": "Explanation 2",
