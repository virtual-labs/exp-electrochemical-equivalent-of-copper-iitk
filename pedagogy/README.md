#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  Student will open the simulator | Simulator will show the complete circuit and others equipments arrangement which has been used during the experiment.  | To initiate the simulator and to rewise the students to the basic equipments required for determing the ECE of copper electrode.  
2.|  Simulator will allow the students to slide the resistance bar| By sliding the bar students will able to chose the value of resistance as per his/her accordance. |To create a load
3.|  Simulator will show the weighing machine| Student will able to weight the Cupper electrode|To measure the initial weight of copper
4.|  Simulator will also show the stopwatch .| Student will use it during experiment running time.  |To note the value of time 
5.|Simulator will allow students to move Cupper electrode | Student will put the Cupper electrode inside the Cupper sulphate solution.<br> |To make the close circuit connection.
6.|  Simulator will allow to students to make click on switch and same time student will ON the stopwatch.|Student will switch ON the circuit and close the circuit and start the stopwatch.|To take current reading and time reading.
7.|  Now simulator will show the current reading.|Student will  pause the stopwatch and break the connection at given interval of time. |To take reading at certain  time interval of time.
